Scholaroid is a collaborative study group platform for students to manage schedules, track tasks, and monitor progress. Built with Node.js, PostgreSQL, and plain HTML/CSS/JS, it will gradually evolve into a MERN stack application. Features include dashboards, task verification, and analytics to boost group motivation and learning.
